= Reactor Security Policy

You can create a draft security advisory by https://github.com/reactor/security-advisories/security/advisories/new[clicking here].

This repository is used to report security advisories to any Reactor Project.
It is an empty repository, so that collaborators can add code from any repository to the private forks created for the advisories.
